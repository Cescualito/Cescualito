# Who is Cescualito?

## Howzit, world? Molweni nonke ðŸ˜„

It is an absolute pleasure meeting you. After giving it some thought, I have decided to join this intimidating platform, despite my lack of experience. I hope to learn a lot, receive helpful feedback, and have the chance to share what I am working on publicly. 

## Professional career ðŸ§ 

Curious by nature, I would define myself as an enthusiastic scientist who finds it essential to conceive research as **indivisible to its social context**. After a BSc in Biomedical Sciences ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/)) and a research MSc in Neurosciences ([UvA](https://www.uva.nl/)), I am currently doing my PhD at [UCT's Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.uct.ac.za/). I am mainly involved in longitudinal neuroimaging studies in resource-limited settings, to investigate **how early life factors impact brain development** in children. Overall, I am an experienced researcher in paediatric MRI, HIV, and malaria, as well as implementation research and training for capacity building in malaria-endemic countries.

### Paediatric HIV exposure ðŸ‘¶

You most definitely have heard about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ([HIV](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet)). **Children born to mothers with HIV but not infected themselves**, called HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), are more likely to have health problems and developmental difficulties than their HIV-unexposed peers (see [Brennan *et al* (2016)](https://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/fulltext/2016/09240/a_meta_analysis_assessing_all_cause_mortality_in.12.aspx) and [Wedderburn *et al* (2022)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(22)00071-2/fulltext#%20)). We're not exactly sure why this happens, but it might be because of changes in the mother's health and immune system during pregnancy, affecting the baby's brain development. Even with treatment to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to child, these babies may still [face challenges](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11904-019-00459-0) with their immune and nervous systems.

> We are currently trying to understand how the immune system and developing brain shape each other in a group of South African mothers with HIV and their HEU children. We have been following these families over time to see how different factors influence the children's health and development.
