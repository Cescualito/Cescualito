# Who is Cescualito?

## Howzit, world? Molweni nonke 😄

It is an absolute pleasure meeting you. After giving it some thought, I have decided to join this intimidating platform, despite my lack of experience. I hope to learn a lot, receive helpful feedback, and have the chance to share what I am working on publicly.

## Professional career 🧠

Curious by nature, I am an enthusiastic scientist who sees research as **inseparable from its social context**. With a BSc in Biomedical Sciences ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/)) and a research MSc in Neurosciences ([UvA](https://www.uva.nl/)), I'm currently pursuing my PhD at [UCT's Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.uct.ac.za/). My focus is on longitudinal neuroimaging studies in resource-limited settings, exploring **how early life factors shape children's brain development**. Experienced in pediatric MRI, HIV, and malaria research, I have also been involved in training and implementation research to strengthen capacities in malaria-endemic countries.

### Paediatric HIV exposure 👶

You most definitely have heard about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ([HIV](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet)). **Children born to mothers with HIV but not infected themselves**, called HIV-exposed and uninfected (HEU), are more likely to have health problems and developmental difficulties than their HIV-unexposed peers (see [Brennan *et al* (2016)](https://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/fulltext/2016/09240/a_meta_analysis_assessing_all_cause_mortality_in.12.aspx) and [Wedderburn *et al* (2022)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(22)00071-2/fulltext#%20)). We're not exactly sure why this happens, but it might be because of changes in the mother's health and immune system during pregnancy, affecting the baby's brain development. Even with treatment to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to child, these babies may still [face challenges](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11904-019-00459-0) with their immune and nervous systems.

> We are currently trying to understand how the **immune system** and **developing brain** shape each other in a group of South African children who are HEU. We have been following them and their mothers over time to see how different factors influence the children's health and development.

### Cerebral malaria 🦟

Malaria is a dangerous infection caused by *Plasmodium* parasites, resulting in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths [each year](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria). One of its severe forms, [cerebral malaria](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1400116), is defined by coma and long-term brain damage. Even after treatment, survivors may experience ongoing cognitive issues. While typically linked with one type of parasite, *Plasmodium falciparum*, there have been cases of other parasite species causing similar **severe neurological problems**.

> Our group has recently shown that [even in malaria patients without coma](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/1/11/6460593?login=true), brain changes can be detected using MRI scans. This suggests that **malaria can harm the brain**, **regardless of coma**, and may have lasting effects on survivors' quality of life.

## Life outside of science 🐋

We might share hobbies such as theatre, hiking, and scuba diving. A rather niche activity that I dare you to try one day is [human towers](https://youtu.be/xo_EKYPNjQE?feature=shared).

## Spoken languages 🗣

Catalan and Spanish are my mother tongues, other than that, here are some languages we can communicate in: <br>
🇬🇧 English <br>
🇧🇷 Português <br>
🇿🇦 isiXhosa
